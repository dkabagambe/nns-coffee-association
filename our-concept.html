          <div>
            <p>
              Coffee for Peace and Development Organization (CPDO), is an
              initiative of mostly youth, who were raised under coffee farmer
              and they understand the role of coffee in their welfare. And these
              farmers were known for growing and selling quality Excelsa coffee
              in the past. Most homes have a few mature trees of Excelsa which
              yield some coffee for home use and domestic market. We intend to
              train farmers to rehabilitate these trees and plant more in
              organized patterns and tipped for ease in management.

            <br/>
              Traditional coffee growing areas were abandoned due to long civil
              war in the Country and not enough markets and as a result most
              coffee farms were destroyed by wildfires.<br/>Due to the influx of returnees, refugees, and internally displaced people (IDPs), Yambio Town has experienced a sudden surge in population. This has resulted in increased demand for food crops and new environmentally friendly cash crops like coffee, moringa, honey, and other foodstuffs. However, many individuals in the community are unaware about the value of coffee. Establishing Youth Coffee Hub in Yambio Town can raise awareness of the value of coffee and other agricultural products among the public, potentially leading to increased production.

        <h1>The Problem and rationale statement</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            The rapid change in the climate due to the high increased population resulted in massive cutting down trees for fuel, settlement, cultivation, and without replacing them back.
             Increased crime recorded within the country due to lack of employment, land grabbing.

             supported by Caritas to showcase and market their products such as honey, wax, propolis, fruits, nuts, roots and tubers, forest harvests, vegetables, sesame paste, moringa powder and oil,  leading to increased motivation of beneficiary smallholders to avail high quality agricultural product.  coffee farms were destroyed by wildfires.<br></br>Due to the influx of returnees, refugees, and internally displaced people (IDPs), Yambio Town has experienced a sudden surge in population.

        <h1>Feasibility</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The success of this initiative depends on the Caritas Austria in South Sudan leadership to instill collaborative efforts by Coffee for Peace and Development Organization (CPDO), Caritas previously and currently supported local organizations, the State Government of Western Equatoria State, and the wider community, which we consider our clients. Clear signage will be placed at the Hub to communicate the
             available services, and radio talk shows will be held to introduce the Hub to the community.
